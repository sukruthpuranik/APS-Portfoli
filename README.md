## Examples

### Dynamic Programming
#### Problem: Rod Cutting Problem
- **File**: `DynamicProgramming/rod_cutting_problem.py`
- **Description**: Given a rod of length n and prices for different lengths, determine the maximum profit obtainable by cutting the rod and selling the pieces.
- **Google Relevance**: This problem can be linked to Google's optimization problems in resource allocation and revenue maximization strategies.

#### Problem: Stolen Value Problem
- **File**: `DynamicProgramming/stolen_value_problem.py`
- **Description**: Find the maximum value of items that can be stolen from houses without stealing from two adjacent houses.
- **Google Relevance**: Similar to the knapsack problem, this can relate to optimizing storage and data retrieval in distributed systems.

### Graph Algorithms
#### Problem: A* Search
- **File**: `GraphAlgorithms/a_star_search.py`
- **Description**: Implement the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a graph.
- **Google Relevance**: This algorithm is fundamental in Google's Maps service for finding the shortest route.

#### Problem: Flow Networks and Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
- **File**: `GraphAlgorithms/ford_fulkerson_algorithm.py`
- **Description**: Implement the Ford-Fulkerson method to compute the maximum flow in a flow network.
- **Google Relevance**: This is used in network optimization, crucial for Google's data centers and cloud infrastructure.

### Advanced Data Structures
#### Problem: Skip List
- **File**: `DataStructures/skip_list.py`
- **Description**: Implement a skip list, an alternative to balanced trees with probabilistic balancing.
- **Google Relevance**: Skip lists can be used in Google's high-performance data storage and retrieval systems.

#### Problem: B+ Tree
- **File**: `DataStructures/b_plus_tree.py`
- **Description**: Implement a B+ tree, a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.
- **Google Relevance**: B+ Trees are used in database indexing, which is critical for Google's vast data services.
