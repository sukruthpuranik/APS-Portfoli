## ðŸ“‹ Introduction

### Domain Overview
Founded in 1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Google has grown from a search engine to a technology giant that offers more than 50 services and products, including email, online document creation and software for mobile devices. It became Alphabet Inc. in 2015. subsidiary. Google's innovative search technology based on website backlink tracking has enabled it to handle more than 70% of global search queries. The company's acquisition strategy, including the purchase of YouTube and Android, increased its dominance. Despite setbacks such as a failed attempt to enter the Chinese market, Google led the way in online advertising and maintained a strong presence in the market with products such as Gmail, Google Maps, Chrome and the Android operating system. In 2011, Google surpassed Apple's iOS in mobile operating system market share. Google+ tried to compete with Facebook in social networking, but it was canceled in 2019. Alphabet's restructuring was aimed at accelerating innovation, and Sundar Pichai was the CEO of both Google and Alphabet(Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2023).

### Market Analysis
Google, now part of Alphabet Inc. subsidiary, remains a dominant force in the global technology market. Its core business, search and advertising, generates most of its revenue, using extensive data collection and sophisticated algorithms to deliver precisely targeted ads. Google's advertising platforms such as Google Ads and YouTube have a significant market share due to strong user engagement and wide reach.Beyond advertising, Google has diversified its revenue through cloud services like Google Cloud, hardware products like Pixel phones and Nest smart home devices, and other businesses like Waymo in autonomous vehicles and Verily in life sciences. The company's focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning continues to drive innovation in its product lines and provide a competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving technology environment. Although Google faces regulatory challenges and competition from other technology giants, Google's strong financial performance and strategic investments ensure its sustainable growth..

**Algorithm**: Johnson-Trotter Algorithm.

**Code**: [Johnson-Trotter Algorithm](SearchAlgorithms/johnson_trotter.cpp)

### Explanation:
The Johnson-Trotter algorithm generates all permutations of a set, which can be useful for various tasks at Google. For instance, it can be used in testing systems to ensure robustness by testing all possible configurations, shuffling search results to provide varied outcomes, and solving combinatorial optimization problems.

### Limitations:

### Explanation:
The Skip List algorithm provides an efficient way to perform search operations with an average time complexity of O(log n). It is useful for indexing and search operations in databases and search engines, such as those used by Google. The Skip List can handle a large number of elements while maintaining quick search times, making it suitable for dynamic data where insertions and deletions are frequent.

### Limitations:
In the worst case, the time complexity can degrade to O(n), especially if the list is not properly balanced.

### 6. Stable Marriage Problem

**Google Relevance**: Useful for job candidate matching systems, user-content pairing, and other matching algorithms.  
**Algorithm**: Stable Marriage Problem.

**Code**: [Stable Marriage Problem](StableMarriageProblem/stable_marriage.cpp)

### Explanation:
The Stable Marriage Problem algorithm finds a stable matching between two sets of elements, such as job candidates and job positions. It ensures that there are no two elements which would prefer each other over their current matches. Google can use this algorithm for matching job candidates to roles, optimizing user-content pairings, and other applications where stable matches are essential.
