### Explanation:
The Rod Cutting problem uses dynamic programming to find the maximum obtainable value by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces. This method is efficient in optimizing resource allocation and can be adapted for various optimization problems at Google, such as cloud resource allocation and ad revenue maximization.

### Limitations:
While the dynamic programming solution is efficient, its performance can degrade with very large inputs due to its quadratic time complexity.
### Explanation:
The Johnson-Trotter algorithm generates all permutations of a set, which can be useful for various tasks at Google. For instance, it can be used in testing systems to ensure robustness by testing all possible configurations, shuffling search results to provide varied outcomes, and solving combinatorial optimization problems.

### Limitations:
The algorithm has a factorial time complexity (O(n!)), making it impractical for very large sets.
### Explanation:
The Skip List algorithm provides an efficient way to perform search operations with an average time complexity of O(log n). It is useful for indexing and search operations in databases and search engines, such as those used by Google. The Skip List can handle a large number of elements while maintaining quick search times, making it suitable for dynamic data where insertions and deletions are frequent.

### Limitations:
In the worst case, the time complexity can degrade to O(n), especially if the list is not properly balanced.
